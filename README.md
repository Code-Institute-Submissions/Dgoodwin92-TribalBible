# Tribal Bible 

Tribal Bible is a child friendly website which will provide the child and parent with biblical infomation on people of the bible. Currently on the internet there are not many well designed child friendly theological websites, most have lots of adds with dull colours, and a lot of text. I have created Tribal Bible to be an up to date, good looking website which children would love to come onto and learn.

## UX

Currently online there are many websites that give Sunday School teachers information about bible stories and characters. These websites are dated, full of adverts and just look ugly. They also do not cater to the children,
the language will be hard for children to understand. Tribal Bible's goal is to reach children who want to learn about the bible without the need for teaching on Sundays.

There are alot of software and apps for adults to access information on theology, this is very lacking in regards to children. This is where the desire and idea for Tribal Bible came from, looking to create a one stop shop for children
to come and learn about Old Testament, New Testament and the people of the Bible. This is not a site to just tell the stories or to water down the Christian theology, the webpage is written for children but not watered down on information.

This website will require user stories from two different sides - The website creator and the potential children to use it.

### **Website Creator**
As the website creator...
* I want children to see this as a helpful and fun place to visit online
* I want children and families to use the website to learn and grow in their faith
* I want families to sign up to recieve further information as well as to keep in communication with them

### **Children (user) Goals**
As a user of the website...
* I want to learn more about the bible 
* I want to see an appealing website which I can interact with
* I do not want to see adverts, I just want to see the content
* I want to find out more information and know when there are updates

## **Features**
Within this project there have been some key features that have been incorporated.

### **Navbar**
The Navbar has been created so that it will collapse as the screen size reduces. Once the Navbar has collapsed a small white bible appears on the top right, this bible replaces a hamburger dropdown navbar. Once clicked it will reveal the navigation links to the different sections.

### **Old Testament** 
Within the Old Testament section of the website there are three cards which look at different people from the Old Testament. These are placed within cards and have a button, once clicked the buttons will open a modal with more information on the chosen subject.

### **Sign Up**
The sign up section of the website is a form which requires the user to enter a name and email address, the form also gives the user an option to write a prayer request. The button which is located at the bottom of the form, will only work if a name and email address are entered. Once clicked this will open a new tab with a thank you response for signing up.

### **Footer**
The footer has a small navigation list of each section of the website, which when hovered over will change colour. The social links within the footer also change colour when hovered over and once clicked will open a new tab which takes the user to the corresponding website of the icon.
